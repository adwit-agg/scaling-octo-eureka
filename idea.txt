* **Project concept**

  * Build a **flood-risk decision support app** for the Philippines that goes beyond “weather forecast” by translating rainfall forecasts into **location-specific flood risk** and **actionable steps**.
  * Core insight: **Flood risk = (forecasted rainfall trigger) × (static flood susceptibility of the location)**.
  * Goal: deliver **clear, low-friction guidance** for individuals/families that can be used quickly during severe weather.

* **Target users**

  * Residents in flood-prone regions (urban + rural), including users with limited data plans.
  * Secondary users: community leaders/organizers who need quick neighborhood-level awareness (optional).

* **Primary user questions the product must answer**

  * “**How at risk am I where I am right now?**”
  * “**When will the risk peak (next 3h / next 24h)?**”
  * “**What should I do right now?**”
  * “**Why is the app saying this?** (sources + explanation)”

* **Inputs the system relies on**

  * **User location**

    * GPS-based lat/lon (primary)
    * Manual location entry (fallback) with map-based selection or place search
  * **Static flood susceptibility**

    * A map layer that classifies geographic areas into categories (e.g., **Low / Moderate / High / Very High flood susceptibility**).
    * Interpreted as **baseline vulnerability** independent of today’s weather.
  * **Dynamic weather forecast**

    * Hourly rainfall/precipitation forecast for the user’s lat/lon.
    * Focus on near-term windows that matter for action (e.g., **next 0–3h, 3–6h, 6–24h**).

* **Core computed outputs**

  * **Baseline risk (static)**

    * The flood susceptibility category at the user’s location.
    * Displayed explicitly as: “Your area is **High** flood susceptibility.”
  * **Rainfall trigger severity (dynamic)**

    * Derived from forecast signals such as:

      * Total precipitation in next **3 hours**
      * Peak hourly precipitation in next **6 hours**
      * Total precipitation in next **24 hours**
    * Converted into a small set of levels (e.g., **Light / Moderate / Heavy / Extreme**).
  * **Combined flood risk tier (final)**

    * A discrete risk level that users can act on:

      * **Low** (Monitor)
      * **Elevated** (Prepare)
      * **High** (Ready to evacuate / strong precautions)
      * **Severe** (Evacuate / immediate safety actions)
    * Must be explainable via: “Because rainfall is forecast to be heavy soon AND your location is high susceptibility…”
  * **Time-to-impact**

    * A simple indicator of urgency:

      * “Risk increasing in **~1–3 hours**”
      * “Highest risk expected **this evening**”
      * “Risk persists through **tomorrow morning**”

* **Decision logic requirements (modeling spec, not implementation)**

  * Combine static + dynamic signals using either:

    * An interpretable **rules/lookup table** (preferred for clarity), or
    * A simple **risk score** that maps to tiers (still explainable).
  * The logic must:

    * Prefer **false positives over false negatives** at higher susceptibility (safety bias).
    * Include **confidence/explanation** messaging (e.g., “moderate confidence” if signals are borderline).
    * Avoid absolute claims (“will flood”) and instead use calibrated language (“flooding likely / risk high”).

* **Action guidance requirements (the “value add”)**

  * Each risk tier must produce **3–7 concise, prioritized actions**.
  * Actions must be:

    * **Specific** (not vague: “prepare” → “charge phone + power bank”, “move valuables above floor level”)
    * **Time-sensitive** (what to do now vs later)
    * **Low-resource** (assume limited equipment)
  * Action sets should be tailored by:

    * Risk tier
    * Short-term timing (e.g., heavy rain within 3h → urgent actions)
  * Example action categories to support:

    * Personal safety (avoid floodwaters, don’t cross moving water)
    * Home protection (elevate items, clear drains if safe)
    * Power/communication readiness (charge devices, keep flashlight)
    * Evacuation readiness (go-bag checklist, meeting plan)
    * Travel advisories (avoid low-lying roads; postpone travel)

* **User-facing “explainability” requirements**

  * Every warning must show:

    * **What**: risk tier + urgency window
    * **Why**: rainfall severity + flood susceptibility at location
    * **Sources**: where the weather and susceptibility data came from
    * **Freshness**: last updated timestamp and forecast horizon
  * A “Details” view should show:

    * Next 24h rainfall chart (hourly)
    * Flood susceptibility label/legend
    * A plain-English summary (“Heavy rain expected soon; you’re in a very flood-prone area.”)

* **Map/visual requirements**

  * Must include a simple map view that can show:

    * User position
    * Flood susceptibility overlay (at least color-coded categories)
    * Optional: “risk bubble” radius indicator (not required)
  * Map should support a “tap anywhere” mode:

    * User taps a point → see susceptibility + forecast-based risk for that point (useful for planning travel / family).

* **Alerts & notifications requirements**

  * Allow opt-in push notifications for:

    * Risk tier increases (e.g., Elevated → High)
    * Severe rain expected within a short window (e.g., next 1–3 hours)
  * Notification content must include:

    * Risk tier
    * Time window
    * One primary action (“Prepare go-bag now”)
  * Provide user controls for:

    * Frequency (“only severe” vs “all changes”)
    * Quiet hours

* **Low-connectivity and resilience requirements**

  * App should remain useful with weak connectivity by supporting:

    * Cached last-known forecast + timestamp
    * Cached action checklists
  * If live data can’t be fetched:

    * Clearly communicate “Using last update from [time]”
    * Still show baseline flood susceptibility + offline preparedness steps

* **Localization and accessibility requirements**

  * Simple, low-reading-load UI (risk color + clear verbs).
  * Optional language support roadmap (English + Filipino languages) as a stated future requirement.
  * Big-text mode / high contrast considerations.

* **Safety and ethical requirements**

  * Must include disclaimers:

    * “Decision-support tool; follow official evacuation orders.”
  * Must avoid panic wording unless risk is severe; messages should be calm, directive, and practical.
  * Must avoid implying government intent/motives; keep messaging focused on user safety.

* **Success criteria (what “works” means)**

  * Given a location, the app reliably:

    * Identifies flood susceptibility category
    * Retrieves rainfall forecast
    * Produces a stable, explainable risk tier
    * Presents actionable steps that a user can follow in <30 seconds
  * Demo success:

    * Switching between 2–3 locations clearly changes susceptibility + risk tier + actions in a way that “makes sense.”

* **Optional stretch requirements (nice-to-have)**

  * Community reporting (“flood observed here”) to supplement situational awareness.
  * Household profile (“ground floor”, “near river”, “no car”) to personalize actions.
  * “Family safety plan” checklist storage (contacts, meeting spot, go-bag inventory).
