All of this is from live API data right now (PAGASA rainfall + MGB susceptibility). The key demo narrative across the three scenarios:

1. **Marikina** — Very High susceptibility area gets a WARNING even with moderate rain. WHY shows the transparent math.
2. **Manila** — SAFE, gets the full menu. Low-pressure interaction.
3. **Davao** — Heavy rain (84mm!) pushes it to WARNING despite only Moderate susceptibility. Farmer and Travel menus show role-specific advice.

You can re-run any of these anytime with `python -m tests.test_pipeline --demo` or the `--coord` flag for any city.
